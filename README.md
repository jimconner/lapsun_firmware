Firmware for the Lapsun 14MP Digital Microscope


As I keep on getting requests for this file from folks on YouTube,
I thought I might as well make life easy for myself and host the file
somewhere accessible. This is the firmware update which I was sent by
Lapsun to address the issue of video corruption when using a USB connection, 
and the lack of a feature to set the timestamp on recordings.

The instructions for installing the firmware are copied verbatim from 
a message I received from Lapsun.


Hello,

You can reset the time/date. I just sent a software to your mail address:
someone@somedomain.com
Pls download it to your TF card and then plug it to the camera,
pls keep the camera turn on during this time. And then open the
software to upgrade. After that, there will add an "time setting "menu,
you could follow it to reset the recording time. Pls try.

Thanks&Best regards
Elva
